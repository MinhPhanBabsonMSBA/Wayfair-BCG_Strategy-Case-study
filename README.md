# Wayfair Case Study 


## 1. Introduction
<a href=http://www.wayfair.com/> Welcome to Wayfair Case Study </a>

 Wayfair ran a large-scale A/B test during the 2016 holiday season to see if a "Ships in Time" guarantee, shown to one in three customers, would influence customer shopping behavior, aiming to determine if the benefits justified the costs before committing to future campaigns.  This report is divided into two key sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and Campaign Effectiveness Analysis to understand how the campaign impacts shopping behavior. We assess campaign success by analyzing purchase, return, and cancellation rates across product categories to capture the complexity of customer behavior. 

## 2.	Explanatory Data Analysis
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aims to visualize and understand customer behavior across different user types and product categories using the Level of Detail to dive into the dataset. By analyzing the interactions between these two key variables—user type and product category—we aim to uncover patterns in purchasing behavior that may provide insights into how Wayfair’s "Ships in Time" guarantee influenced customer decisions and how the ordering process works (individual or set product) and if the data is well organized.

## 4.	Campaign Effectiveness Analysis
Wayfair's "Ships in Time" guarantee influenced customer behavior variably across product categories. While it boosted purchases in categories like Mattresses, Small Electrics, and Kitchen items indicating that delivery speed may matter more for these products for the holiday season, it also led to higher return rates, suggesting unmet product or delivery expectations. The campaign's effect on cancellation and return rates was mixed; it helped reduce cancellations but did not significantly lower returns across the board. To enhance future campaigns, Wayfair should target the guarantee on time-sensitive, high-demand categories, clarify guarantee terms, and tailor messaging to manage customer expectations effectively, thereby boosting satisfaction and operational efficiency.
